2. What do you know about BDD in rails ? 
   BDD stands for Behaviour Driven Development.
   Before writing code, we have to specify how code will behave, what will be input and output for piece of code.
   After writing behavour code we can write actual code.
   eg. rspec and cucumber.
   rSpec are generally written for the models.
   cucumber is the way to test the application behaviour and it is written for views (i.e. for UI)
